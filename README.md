# blocipedia-node

A wiki-pedia like web application that allows users to share information!

Please explore this application at: https://zguerrin27-blocipedia.herokuapp.com/

You can browser public wikis as a guest, and log up for a free account. Upon doing so you can edit and create wikis. 
There is also an option to view your public profile and sign up for a paid premium account. There is fake card data on the site
if you would like to upgrade your acccount. 

Throughout this project I learned a great deal about the Model View Controller design pattern, as well as authentication
and validation of information. 

If I had more time....I would continue to style the application, and add more functionality like the ability to upload pictures.
